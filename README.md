# Checli
 Checli is a cli checklist that takes a list from stdin and displays it with [bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea).
 One can then navigate and filter the list, pressing `enter` removes the selected item. Useful for working through a list of items and not losing one's place.

# Usage

`rg -n something-to-check | go run github.com/ralph7c2/checli`
